Your body moves through four distinct hormonal phases each month, each with its own rhythm, needs, and magic. At Femure, we call this cycle syncing ‚Äî living, eating, working, and resting in alignment with your hormonal flow. It's the most natural way to reclaim balance, energy, and self-connection.",
